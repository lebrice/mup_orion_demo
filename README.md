# mup_orion_demo

Demo of [mup](https://www.github.com/microsoft/mup) with [Orion](https://www.github.com/epistimio/orion).

[mup](https://www.github.com/microsoft/mup) is a brilliant research project, that makes it possible to tune the hyper-parameter of large-scale machine learning models by transferring the parameters found when tuning a smaller version of the same model.

This can dramatically reduce the amount of compute required to optimize very large models, potentially saving millions of dollars in training cost!

This is a demo of how to use mup to train a transformer from [mutransformers](https://www.github.com/microsoft/mutransformers) with Orion.
